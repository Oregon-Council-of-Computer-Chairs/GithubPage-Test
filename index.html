                  Welcome to the Oregon Council of Computer Chairs Web Page
            </h2>
            <p>
                  Our mission is the promotion and coordination of computing curriculum among the public community colleges and universities in Oregon.

                  The purpose of this web site is to provide a means for sharing information among members of the OCCC (Oregon's 17 Community Colleges and
                  Universities) and other interested parties. Although the OCCC is primarily concerned with computer related course offerings, 
                  programs, and degrees at public community colleges in Oregon, our membership also includes representatives from the Oregon public universities.
            </p>
