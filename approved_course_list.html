            <p>
                 One of the tasks/goals of the OCCC is the development, maintenance, and coordination of a list of common course numberings.

            </p>
            <p>
                 The following list of computer courses has meet the approval of the OCCC. Course numbers ending with the 'x' suffix means that a college may attach their own letter(s) to signify the application or language being taught. The course prefix may also vary slightly, depending on individual college requirements (see note below), but should signify the Computer Science or Computer Information Systems discipline. 200-level courses are considered to have a 100-level course(s) prerequisite.
            </p>
            <p>
                 Courses in <span class="makered">RED</span> have been approved for the "AAOT" and the "Oregon Transfer Module" Science/Mathematics/Computer Science distribution requirement as non-lab science courses. All other courses may be used as general electives. [approved: 10/21/2005]
